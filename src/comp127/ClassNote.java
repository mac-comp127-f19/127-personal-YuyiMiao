     *  private instance variables enforce the rules for a class.
     *  Modify? Go to approved methods.
     *  Special case:
     *      public static final classwide var:
     *          Math.PI
     *  Good practice:
     *      use "this" with all instance variables
     *  public <return type> <name> (argument list)
     *  The instance variables are always declared outside the constructor method, but initialized within it.
     *  It is because of the scope.
     *  Instance variables should exist along the life-time of the object, thus we need to declare them in a "class" level.
